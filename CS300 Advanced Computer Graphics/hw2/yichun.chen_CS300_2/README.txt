a. Use the radio button to select normal display, object model, and shader.

b. When loading lucy_princeton.obj and bunny_high_poly.obj it takes a long time to load,
   especially lucy_princeton.obj. When loaded lucy_princeton.obj the scene becomes very laggy.
   On some machine the program might appear frozen.
   Will ask professor or TA on how to improve performance.
   
c. Can switch between shaders. Phone lighting, phone shading and blinn shading implemented.
   
d. I have trouble setting up the lighting scene, and can't figure it out. Lighting scene setup,
   material setup not implemented.
   
e. Most of the files are in the "source" folder, shader.vs/fs are inside the "shader" folder.

f. Windows 10, GeForce GTX 1050/PCIe/SSE2, Geforce Driver 456.38 9-14-2020 Version86.7.3c.0.46

g. I totally messed up, only worked at the progject last week and the week after the due date.
   And I can't get things to work. I'll work on project 3 and see if I can get project 2 fixed
   and see if I can have chance to resubmit it.
