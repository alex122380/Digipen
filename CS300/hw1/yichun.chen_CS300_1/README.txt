a. Use the radio button to select between display vertex normal, face normal or none.

b. When loading lucy_princeton.obj and bunny_high_poly.obj it takes a long time to load,
   especially lucy_princeton.obj. When loaded lucy_princeton.obj the scene becomes very laggy.
   On some machine the program might appear frozen.
   Will ask professor or TA on how to improve performance.
   
c. Can read data from .obj file and render the model.
   Rendered 8 spheres(procedurally generated) rotate around the model.
   Rendered the orbit of the spheres.
   Rendered the vertex normal and face normal.
   Diffuse lighting is implemented.
   Uses imGui for GUI.
   
d. As in the b. part, I need to improve my program's performance. Rendering lucy_princeton.obj
   make the program lagging.
   
e. Most of the files are in the "source" folder, shader.vs/fs are inside the "shader" folder.

f. Windows 10, GeForce GTX 1050/PCIe/SSE2, Geforce Driver 456.38 9-14-2020 Version86.7.3c.0.46

g. I mis-managed my time. Didn't work on the project in the first four weeks.
   Spent 30 hours in week 5.
