a. Use the radio button to select normal display, object model, and shader.

b. When loading lucy_princeton.obj and bunny_high_poly.obj it takes a long time to load,
   especially lucy_princeton.obj. When loaded lucy_princeton.obj the scene becomes very laggy.
   On some machine the program might appear frozen.
   Will ask professor or TA on how to improve performance.
   
c. Can render to a texture and apply the texture to each face of the cube.
   
d. I only able to make diffuse shader to have the ability to render to texture, so switch to other shader will render some black models.
   
e. Most of the files are in the "source" folder, shader.vs/fs are inside the "shader" folder.

f. Windows 10, GeForce GTX 1050/PCIe/SSE2, Geforce Driver 456.38 9-14-2020 Version86.7.3c.0.46

g. I stuck at making render to texture to work. It always shows as black texture. When I finally get it to work, it is already too late.
   I can't get other functions to work.
